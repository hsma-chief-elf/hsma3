    "**Task 1** Write a function that takes as its inputs two lists of any size, and then compares them to see how many common elements they have (ie how many things in one list are also in the other), and returns this number.  Try the function out by calling it with two lists (try playing with various number of common elements to test it), and after the function is called, print a message that confirms how many elements are common to both lists.  You should add exception handling such that if anything other than two lists are passed to the function, a message appears saying that something went wrong, and the message about the number of common elements is never displayed.  Test the error handling by trying to pass something other than two lists (e.g. one list, three lists, an integer etc)."
