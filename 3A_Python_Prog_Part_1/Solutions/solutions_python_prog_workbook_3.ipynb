You should be completing this when prompted by the trainer as Exercise 4 of the session.  You should read each task, and then try to write code to achieve what you are being asked in the code cell below each set of instructions.  Remember - check your code is working by running the code cell (CTRL + Enter whilst in the cell, or click the play button in the bar at the top)."

    "**Task 3** You have crashed on a mysterious island.  After several years, you walk into a cave and discover mysterious writings on the wall that associate numbers with the surname of PenCHORD team members : \"4 - Chalk, 8 - Allen, 15 - Monks, 16 - Pearn, 23 - Salmon, 42 - Harper\".  Perplexed by this, you decide you should probably write a piece of Python code that stores these entries in a dictionary called \"candidates\", and which allows the user to input a number to find out the corresponding \"candidate\" surname.  If the user inputs a candidate number that doesn't exist, the system should warn them of this and allow them to input again.  The system should also keep asking the user to input candidate numbers until the user types -1, at which point the program says \"Goodbye\" and terminates."
